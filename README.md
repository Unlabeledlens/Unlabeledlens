- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything it is to build a website im an amatuer so any and all help would be great
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a Wrold news forum, segregated in 3 formats governance, Travel, economy (yes I dream big )

- 😄 Pronouns: Honest Human
- ⚡ Fun fact: The people should not be afraid of the government, the governents should be afraid of the people.   The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.
